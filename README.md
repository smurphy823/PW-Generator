# PW-Generator

My personal code includes HTML, CSS and JS for my random password generator.

This specific page includes a navbar and a password genertor.

The password generator allows you to generate a password of up to 20 characters.  

It also allows you to view your previous generated passwords and copy your generated password to the clip board.

My style.css page consists of the display with the content for the margin's top and bottom, the backround color, the padding and the width.  It also consists of the sliders length and width, and the margin of the previous passwords.

My script.js page consists of the function for the passwords length and value.

My index.html consists of a container with a row and two div classes along with a footer.
